## Implementation

The project was running with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and designing a visualization with D3. Here's a brief overview of the implementation according to the Grading:

## Grade 4 (50% - 62%)

### 10%: Submitting according to the procedure

- I summitted my A3 both on Moodle and on the Uni Wien Almighty servers.
- I used FileZilla to connect to the Uni Wien Almighty servers. I summitted my dist folder generated by thr command 'npm run build' according to the Submission instructions.
- On Moodle I first zip all of my folder with all needed folder and uploaded them in the Moodle. The Submission instructions mentioned that the folder need to contain an index.html file which will open the view. I'm not sure what does it mean exactly, so I just save the site of the view from my browser.

### 30%: Creating a scatter plot

- I implemented the scatter plot component with the help of the BarChart.vue, including the SVG element, mounted lifecycle hook, drawChart method, X and Y axes, computed properties and watchers. I modified some data to fit my scatter plot.
- Intead of using the drawBar method from BarChart.vue, I created a drawScatter method, which first combined data by filtering and mapping relevant data from educational attainment and personal income sources. Then I created a background color grid based on a color map. At last I drawed circles (scatter points) based on the combined data, using scales for positioning and color mapping.
- In order to use the color where the circles are at, I creaed a stateColors object and stored the color associated with each state. And I emitted the updateStateColors event to update the color when the year changes.
- Then I went to the App.vue and defined the stateColors and implemented the updateStateColors method, I let the Scatterplot component listen for the 'updateStateColors' event. It triggers the method in the App.vue when there's an update.

### 25%: Creating a choropleth map

- The ChoroplethMap component have similar template, script, watcher, mounted lifecycle hook like the BarChart and Scatterplot. In the script section I imported the GeoJSON file (us-states-geo.json). It has also the stateColors prop I created in ScatterPlot.vue. The prop is used to pass the colors associated with each state from a parent component to the ChoroplethMap.
- In the drawMap method I used geoAlbersUsa projection to create a map projection to fits the size. After that I used D3's geoPath to create a path generator based on the projection. Then I selected all path elements (states) and binds the GeoJSON features to them, seted the d attribute of each path.
- I colored each state from the stateColors prop by using method getColorForState, which retrieves the color associated with a specific state from the stateColors object.

## Grade 3 (62.5% - 74.5%)

### 7.5%: Implement a year slider

- the year slider was provided. I just implement watcher to make sure that the data displayed both in the choropleth and the scatter plot change when the year change.

### 5%: On mouseover each data point (circle) on the scatter plot shows a tooltip containing the name of that state.

- I implemented showTooltip and hideTooltip methods for the mouseover. The showTooltip selects a chart element, appends a tooltip with content from the state parameter, and applies a smooth transition for visibility.
